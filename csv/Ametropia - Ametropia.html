Diffraction is at its maximum in small aperture systems and is therefore the most correct answer. <br><br>Radial astigmatism is a type of Seidel aberration that happens when the light passing through the edge of the lens (which is off-center from the pupil) gets bent more than the light passing through the center of the lens. This causes the light to form an oblong shape instead of a circular shape on the retina, which can make objects appear distorted or blurry. This effect is typically more prominent in wide aperture systems. <br><br>Coma is another Seidel aberration that causes light rays to be focused at different angles and positions within the pupil, resulting in images that are distorted and comet-shaped. Coma is typically more prominent in wide aperture systems. <br><br>Spherical aberration, another Seidel aberration, occurs when light rays passing through different portions of a lens or mirror are focused at different distances from the optical axis, resulting in blurred or distorted images. Spherical aberration is typically more prominent in wide aperture systems. <br><br>Depth of focus is the range of distances over which an object appears to be in focus in an image.

First, the equivalent power must be calculated: Fₑ = F₁ + F₂ − (t/n)F₁F₂. With t/n = 0.02/1.50 = 0.0133 m, the equivalent power is Fₑ = 15 + 5 − (0.0133)(15)(5) = 20 − 1.0 = +19.00 D. The position of H&#39; is then A₂H&#39; = −(0.0133)(15) / 19 = −0.20 / 19 = −0.0105 m = −10.5 mm. The negative sign indicates H&#39; lies 10.5 mm to the left of the back surface, placing it inside the lens.</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px"><th id="916876786R34" style="height: 17px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 17px">35</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Optics (Geometrical)</td><td class="freezebar-cell"></td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">Thick Lenses</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">Vertex power and equivalent power</td><td class="s3" dir="ltr">A thick biconvex crown glass lens (n = 1.50) has a front surface power of +10.00 D, a back surface power of +5.00 D, and a center thickness of 15 mm.

The back vertex power formula accounts for how vergence changes as light travels through the lens thickness. Using Fv = F₁ / [1 − (t/n)F₁] + F₂, the reduced thickness is t/n = 0.015/1.50 = 0.01 m. Substituting values: Fv = 10.00 / [1 − (0.01)(10.00)] + 5.00 = 10.00 / 0.90 + 5.00 = 11.11 + 5.00 = +16.11 D, which rounds to +16.10 D. The nominal power of +15.00 D (simple sum of surface powers) underestimates the lensometer reading because it ignores vergence gain through the lens. The equivalent power of +14.50 D is measured from the principal planes and differs from back vertex power. The front vertex power of +15.25 D would be measured if parallel light entered the back surface instead.</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px"><th id="916876786R35" style="height: 17px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 17px">36</div></th><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Optics (Geometrical)</td><td class="freezebar-cell"></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">Thick Lenses</td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">Lateral (translinear) and angular magnification</td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">A polycarbonate spectacle lens (n = 1.586) has a back vertex power of +8.00 D, a front surface power of +12.00 D, and a center thickness of 6.0 mm.

The shape factor accounts for magnification due to lens form and thickness, calculated as SF = 1/(1 − (t/n)·F₁) = 1/(1 − (0.006/1.586) × 12.00) = 1/(1 − 0.0454) = 1/0.9546 = 1.048.

For an emmetropic reduced eye, parallel light from infinity focuses exactly on the retina at the secondary focal length: f&#39; = n&#39;/F = 1.333/60.00 = 22.22 mm. In axial myopia, the eye is elongated beyond this emmetropic length, causing distant objects to focus in front of the retina. To find the axial length of a 4.00 D myopic eye, we determine where light from the far point would focus. The far point of a 4.00 D myope is 25 cm in front of the eye, producing an object vergence of −4.00 D at the principal plane. Applying the vergence relationship: L&#39; = L + F = −4.00 + 60.00 = +56.00 D. The axial length equals l&#39; = n&#39;/L&#39; = 1.333/56.00 = 0.02381 m = 23.81 mm. The answer 22.22 mm represents the emmetropic axial length. The answer 21.65 mm would result from a hyperopic eye with the same magnitude of refractive error.

This unequal distribution increases spherical aberration because peripheral rays are bent too sharply at the curved surface.<br><br>The principle extends to other lens forms as well. For any lens focusing distant light, the more curved surface should generally face the object. Conversely, when forming an image at a distant location, the more curved surface should face the image.

For a plus lens, marginal rays passing through the peripheral zones are refracted more strongly and focus closer to the lens than paraxial rays passing near the optical center. This creates a blur circle rather than a sharp focal point. When pupils dilate, peripheral lens zones contribute to image formation, increasing the impact of spherical aberration. <br><br>With dilation, aberrated marginal rays reach the retina and focus at a different plane, degrading image quality despite accurate refractive correction. This explains why patients with dilated pupils may experience reduced acuity and why some individuals see better in bright light when smaller pupils limit the eye to paraxial rays. In the human eye, the cornea produces positive spherical aberration while the young crystalline lens contributes negative spherical aberration that partially compensates. This balance shifts with age as lens shape changes, which contributes to increased higher-order aberrations in older patients. <br><br>Incorrect Choice Explanations: Different wavelengths focusing at different distances describes chromatic aberration, which results from dispersion of light through optical media. While present in the eye, chromatic aberration is not specifically worsened by pupil dilation in the manner described. Off-axis object points producing asymmetric images describes coma, an aberration affecting oblique rays that creates characteristic comet-shaped blur patterns pointing toward or away from the optical axis. A curved retinal image of a flat object describes curvature of field, where the focal surface is curved rather than flat. This aberration affects the shape of the image plane rather than causing the on-axis blur associated with dilated pupils.</td></tr><tr style="height: 17px"><th id="916876786R39" style="height: 17px;"
